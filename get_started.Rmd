```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)
library(webshot)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "##")

# Print HTML tags as HTML text
knit_print.shiny.tag <- function(x, ...) {
  as.character(x)
}
```


## Installation

**shinydashboard** requires Shiny 0.11 or above. To install, run:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# First install devtools if you don't already have it installed, with:
# install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("rstudio/shiny")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/shinydashboard")
```

## Basics

A dashboard has three parts: a header, a sidebar, and a body. Here's the most minimal possible UI for a dashboard page.

```{r eval=FALSE}
## ui.R ##
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)

dashboardPage(
  dashboardHeader(),
  dashboardSidebar(),
  dashboardBody()
)
```


You can quickly view it at the R console by using the `shinyApp()` function:

```{r eval=FALSE}
## app.R ##
ui <- dashboardPage(
  dashboardHeader(),
  dashboardSidebar(),
  dashboardBody()
)

server <- function(input, output) { }

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
appshot('_apps/blank_dashboard/', 'images/blank_dashboard.png',
  delay=1, vheight=300
) %>%
  resize('50%') %>%
  shrink()
```

Obviously, this dashboard isn't very useful. But before we dive into the parts of a dashboard, we need to take a step back and understand how a Shiny UI works.


## Background: Shiny and HTML

To understand how these parts work together, we first need to know how a Shiny UI is built, and how it relates to the HTML of a web page.

The HTML tag functions in Shiny, like `div()` and `p()` return objects that can be rendered as HTML. For example, when you run these commands at the R console, it will print out HTML:

```{r}
# A basic div
div(class = "my-class", "Div content")

# Nested HTML tags
div(class = "my-class", p("Paragraph text"))
```

Some functions return more complex HTML fragments, and they insulate you, the user, from having to know all the ins and outs of the HTML required to create things like a text input or a sidebar:

```{r}
textInput("Id", "Label")

sidebarPanel(
  div("First div"),
  div("Second div")
)
```

The UI for a Shiny app is built out of these pieces of HTML. The **shinydashboard** package provides a set of functions designed to create HTML that will generate a dashboard. If you copy the UI code for a dashboard page (above) and paste into the R console, it will print out HTML for the dashboard.
