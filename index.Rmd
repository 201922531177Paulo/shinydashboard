```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)
library(webshot)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "##")

# Print HTML tags as HTML text
knit_print.shiny.tag <- function(x, ...) {
  as.character(x)
}
```

The **shinydashboard** package lets you create dashboards like this:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
appshot('_apps/dashboard/', 'images/dashboard.png',
  delay=1, vheight=800, cliprect = "viewport"
) %>%
  resize('50%') %>%
  shrink()
```

## Basics

A dashboard has three parts: a header, a sidebar, and a body. Here's the most minimal possible UI for a dashboard page.

```{r eval=FALSE}
## ui.R ##
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)

dashboardPage(
  dashboardHeader(),
  dashboardSidebar(),
  dashboardBody()
)
```


You can quickly view it by embedding it in a single-file app:

```{r eval=FALSE}
## app.R ##
ui <- dashboardPage(
  dashboardHeader(),
  dashboardSidebar(),
  dashboardBody()
)

server <- function(input, output) { }

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
appshot('_apps/blank_dashboard/', 'images/blank_dashboard.png',
  delay=1, vheight=300
) %>%
  resize('75%') %>%
  shrink()
```

Obviously, this dashboard isn't very useful. But before we dive into the parts of a dashboard, we need to take a step back and understand how a Shiny UI works.


## Background: Shiny and HTML

To understand how these parts work together, we first need to understand how a Shiny UI is built, and how it relates to the HTML of a web page.

The HTML tag functions in Shiny, like `div()`, return objects that can be rendered as HTML. For example:

```{r}
# A basic div
div(class = "my-class", "Div content")

# Nested HTML tags
div(class = "my-class", p("Paragraph text"))
```

Some functions return more complex HTML, and they insulate you, the user, from having to know all the ins and outs of the HTML required to do things like create a text input or a sidebar:

```{r}
textInput("Id", "Label")


sidebarPanel(
  div("First div"),
  div("Second div")
)
```

The UI for a Shiny app is built out of these pieces of HTML. The **shinydashboard** package provides a set of functions designed to create HTML that will generate a dashboard.
